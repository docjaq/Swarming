# Swarming

- Quick Unity project to test out a described Swarming algorithm
- Testable in WebGL here: https://docjaq.github.io/Swarming/index.html
- Swarm spawning is random, so start is less than ideal
- Swarm robots pause if lead robot velocity is close to 0
- There are probably bugs in the UI/creation/deletion - added it right at the end for the WebGL build
- Note: actually slightly simplified in a few ways over what was discussed. Might benefit from some more work, and ability to parameterise different behaviours of the swarm/flock.

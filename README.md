# Swarming

- Quick Unity project to test out a described Swarming algorithm
- Testable in WebGL here: https://docjaq.github.io/Swarming/index.html
- Swarm spawning is random, so start is less than idea
- Simulation pauses if lead robot velocity is close to 0
- There are probably bugs in the UI/creation/deletion - added it right at the end for the WebGL build
